### About Me:
Recently, I just finished a contract with DXC (Formerly HPE & CSC) in a senior position to pursue a relevant university qualification within the realm of IT. I have been working in the Industry since I was 15 years old, as my father used to have me come into his business to support his staff and maintain the equipment.
Currently, I have a tortoise shell kitten named Luna and a Maltese Terrier named Odie. My passions include but are not limited to; video games, movies, basketball, philosophy and eating out.  Furthermore, in 2015 I was signed to a major E-Sports organisation and played video games competitively for 2 years.

### Education
I have attended an all-boys private school since I was 8 years old* undertaking a variety of both academic and personal challenges including the Australian Cadet Unit and even some Australian mathematical and science competitions.
Furthermore, in 2016 I completed a CompTIA A+ IT certification as a bonus from my employer at the time. 

## Interest in IT:
I have always had an interest in computers – even from a very young age. I would assume the spark was ignited when my father bought our family’s first computer for the purposes of ‘study’ as my eldest sister had just entered into high school at the time. Obviously, study is not the only thing it was used for as I remember eagerly sitting behind my sister watching her play browser games and chat with her friends on MSN messenger. Ever since then, I have been drawn to the IT sphere whether it be in free time or in my professional career. My work experience in IT includes positions in various companies such as DXC, MyHealth Medical, Mortgage Choice and Downer**. 

### Why RMIT?
I have chosen to study at RMIT University as I believe that pursuing additional tertiary qualifications will help develop myself both academically and professionally. Moreover, I have always wanted to be apart of the development of software applications. As the world moves towards a more technology assisted society, I personally believe that skills within the IT sphere will become more and more necessary. 
What do you expect to learn during your studies?
The ideal end-goal for my studies has changed quite a lot since it’s first inception quite a few months ago. I believe that as I progress through my studies it will allow me to develop a clear understanding of what the different areas of IT are and exact avenues I wish to pursue. At the current moment, I am hoping that by the end of my time here, I will be able to create/develop my own programs from scratch.
