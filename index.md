## About Me:
Recently, I just finished a contract with DXC (Formerly HPE & CSC) in a senior position to pursue a relevant university qualification within the realm of IT. I have been working in the Industry since I was 15 years old, as my father used to have me come into his business to support his staff and maintain the equipment.
Currently, I have a tortoise shell kitten named Luna and a Maltese Terrier named Odie. My passions include but are not limited to; video games, movies, basketball, philosophy and eating out.  Furthermore, in 2015 I was signed to a major E-Sports organisation and played video games competitively for 2 years.

## Education
I have attended an all-boys private school since I was 8 years old* undertaking a variety of both academic and personal challenges including the Australian Cadet Unit and even some Australian mathematical and science competitions.
Furthermore, in 2016 I completed a CompTIA A+ IT certification as a bonus from my employer at the time.
